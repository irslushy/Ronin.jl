For this, we will use the calculate_features function. Since we are calculating features to train a model at this point, we will assume that intreactive QC has already been applied to them. To get the most skillful model possible, we will want to remove \"easy\" cases from the training set, so set REMOVE_LOW_NCP=true and REMOVE_HIGH_PGG=true to ignore data not meeting minimum quality thresholds. It's also important to specify which variable contained with the input scans has already been QC'ed - in the ELDORA scans, this is VG. missing values must also be removed from the initial training set, so we'll use a raw variable VV to determine where these gates are located.
