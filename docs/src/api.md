# Basic Workflow Walkthrough 
RadarQC is a package that utilizes a methodology developed by [Dr. Alex DesRosiers and Dr. Michael Bell](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/aies/aop/AIES-D-23-0064.1/AIES-D-23-0064.1.xml) to remove non-meteorological gates from Doppler radar scans by leveraging machine learning techniques. In its current form, it contains functionality to derive a set of features from input radar data, use these features to train a Random Forest classification model, and apply this model to the raw fields contained within the radar scans. It also has some model evaluation ability. The beginning of this guide will walk through a basic workflow to train a model starting from scratch.
